## Serializer Relations
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations/#serializer-relations

In Django REST Framework (DRF), serializers are used to convert complex data types such as Django model instances into native Python data types that can be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types. Serializers also provide deserialization, allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types, after validating the incoming data. Serializer relations are a way to represent relationships between models, such as foreign key and many-to-many relationships.

Here are the common types of serializer relations in DRF with examples:

### 1. **PrimaryKeyRelatedField**

This field is used to represent a target of the relationship using its primary key.

**Example:**

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from myapp.models import Singer, Song

class SongSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Song
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'duration', 'singer']

class SingerSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    songs = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(many=True, read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Singer
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'gender', 'songs']
```

In this example, `songs` in the `SingerSerializer` will be a list of primary keys of the related `Song` instances.

### 2. **StringRelatedField**

This field uses the `__str__` method of the related instance to represent the relationship.

**Example:**

```python
class SongSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Song
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'duration', 'singer']

class SingerSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    songs = serializers.StringRelatedField(many=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Singer
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'gender', 'songs']
```

In this example, `songs` will be a list of string representations of the related `Song` instances.

### 3. **HyperlinkedRelatedField**

This field is used to represent the relationship using a hyperlink.

**Example:**

```python
class SongSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    singer = serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField(view_name='singer-detail', read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Song
        fields = ['url', 'id', 'title', 'duration', 'singer']

class SingerSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    songs = serializers.HyperlinkedRelatedField(many=True, view_name='song-detail', read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Singer
        fields = ['url', 'id', 'name', 'gender', 'songs']
```

In this example, `songs` in the `SingerSerializer` and `singer` in the `SongSerializer` will be hyperlinks to the related instances.

### 4. **SlugRelatedField**

This field is used to represent the target of the relationship using a field on the target.

**Example:**

```python
class SongSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    singer = serializers.SlugRelatedField(slug_field='name', read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Song
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'duration', 'singer']

class SingerSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    songs = serializers.SlugRelatedField(many=True, read_only=True, slug_field='title')

    class Meta:
        model = Singer
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'gender', 'songs']
```

In this example, `singer` in the `SongSerializer` will be represented by the `name` field of the `Singer` instance, and `songs` in the `SingerSerializer` will be represented by the `title` field of the `Song` instances.

### 5. **Nested Relationships**

This field allows for the full representation of related instances.

**Example:**

```python
class SongSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Song
        fields = ['id', 'title', 'duration']

class SingerSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    songs = SongSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Singer
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'gender', 'songs']
```

In this example, `songs` in the `SingerSerializer` will include all the fields defined in `SongSerializer`, providing a full representation of each `Song` instance.

### Example Views and URLs

To connect these serializers to your views and URLs, you can use viewsets and routers. Hereâ€™s an example:

```python
# views.py
from rest_framework import viewsets
from myapp.models import Singer, Song
from myapp.serializers import SingerSerializer, SongSerializer

class SingerViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Singer.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SingerSerializer

class SongViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Song.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SongSerializer
```

```python
# urls.py
from django.urls import include, path
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from myapp import views

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'singers', views.SingerViewSet)
router.register(r'songs', views.SongViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include(router.urls)),
]
```

In this setup, the `SingerViewSet` and `SongViewSet` are registered with a router, which automatically generates the necessary URLs for listing, retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting singers and songs. The serializers handle the representation of relationships as specified.
